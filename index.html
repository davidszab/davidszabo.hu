                    I was a contractor working on developing a web application
                    to let users view their metrics recorded by the company's
                    device. One could create multiple graphs with content
                    tailored to their needs. The project was implemented in
                    TypeScript using open-source libraries, including React.
                    Later on, a Google Drive integration was added to let users
                    open files directly from their cloud storage as well. My
                    work was used as a staple for more than a year during the
                    open-beta testing of the product.

                    I am a registered volunteer of AFS Intercultural Programs'
                    Hungarian branch. For the past four years, I have had the
                    chance to work with amazing people and learn essential soft
                    skills. In the academic year 2022-2023, I worked on
                    developing and improving the volunteer base in the country's
                    biggest chapter, the Budapest chapter. The next academic
                    year, I became the chapter president, overseeing and
                    managing the things happening in the chapter. During these
                    periods, I developed valuable skills regarding logistics,
                    planning, and interpersonal communication. During my time as
                    a member of the chapter management team, I have introduced
                    many digital solutions, including <b>automations</b> and

                Spotify API. The app is currently under development and has not
                yet been released for everyone; testers have to be added in the

              <h3>Certifio</h3>
              <p>
                A full-stack web application written in TypeScript using React
                and Node.js for issuing digital certificates. The project aims
                to provide an application that can be self-hosted by
                organisations to help them recognise the achievements of their
                members. A user can authenticate with magic links to review
                their data stored in the system. Administrators have the ability
                to issue new certificates. A Dockerfile is provided for easy
                deployment of the backend. Due to the nature of the project, all
                capabilities cannot be reviewed anonymously. If you're
                interested, request a demo from me!

                <h3>Hungarian exercises</h3>
                <p>Originally meant for AFS exchange students staying in Hungary who I have helped to study Hungarian. The aim of this site is to let people practice dynamic language elements like numbers and reading the clock. I wanted to provide an experience that lets people practice easily by having the opportunity to review these topics repetitively. The app was written in React and uses frontend-only technologies because secure server-side validation of the answers was out of the scope of this project.</p>

                <h3>Paddlemate Data Analisys Tool</h3>
                <p>During my time at Paddlemate, my task was to develop a web application that could be used to create custom graphs from the data generated by the tracking devices. After opening the file from the local device or downloading it from the cloud with the Google Drive integration, one can create graphs with customisable content. The application also displays the route on a map. The project was used as a staple during the open beta phase of the Paddlemate product. I cannot provide a public demo, but if you are interested, a private demo is possible.</p>
